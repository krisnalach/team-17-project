# BlitzJack - Team 17's Project

## Installation instructions
- clone the repository onto your machine
- run `npm install` to install necessary dependencies
- for milestone-02, run `npm run milestone-02`
- the server should start on localhost:3000

### Limitations/Notes
- UI designs aren't fully fleshed out yet, but the general idea of how they'll look is there
- There are errors thrown in the console purposefully during certain events (i.e. user not being logged in)
