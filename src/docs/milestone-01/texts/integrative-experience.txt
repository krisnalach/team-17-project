Throughout the course of our academic careers we have had many classes that have taught us the skills needed to complete this project. In programming methodology (CS220) we learned JavaScript which will allow us to create the functionality and game logic required in order to make a working blackjack program. Introduction to informatics (INFO101) taught us how to write HTML and CSS in order to create a website introducing ourselves. These two classes taught us basic skills that we built on in CS320 where we learned to differentiate front-end and back-end. Introduction to human-computer interaction (CS325) taught us the importance of making our programs accessible and having user-friendly interfaces. 


The main reason we chose to do this project was because most of us have had great experiences playing card games like poker and blackjack with friends, but at a casino the experience is completely different. When you play with a small group of friends the focus is usually on socializing with each other and having fun, not solely on trying to win money. We know how fun some of these classic card games like blackjack are and we think that seeing them only for their gambling aspects is cutting some people away from being able to enjoy the game. In the United States today, gambling is being promoted more than ever. You can’t watch a sports game for 10 minutes before seeing a DraftKings or FanDuel advertisement. Gambling sites are so dangerous as they allow people an instant way to risk massive amounts of money. Gambling is also an addictive activity as has been seen many times in the past. We want to create a simple and fun way to enjoy one of the most iconic card games without needing to worry about the risk of losing your money.
